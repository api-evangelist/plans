      information about plans available as part of platform operations. There may
      be more than one plan overview page available, for example one for SaaS side
      of offering, one for developers, and another possibly for enterprise or partner
      consumers.

    name: Private
    about: Is this plan a private one, available only to a limited audience? While
      the landing page, or overall portal might be publicly available, the API access
      itself requires approval, or existing account access before you can get more
      details. Private APIs are more common than public APIs, but you should think
      about the pros / cons of keeping things private.

    about: There is a regular, recurring element to accessing a resource, as part
      of a larger subscription part of, or separated from plans. In addition to the
      regular usage, a subscription plan usually continues, and has costs associated
      with it even if there are no calls against the API made.

    name: PaaS
    about: Is the API operations secondary to a strong PaaS focus for a platform.
      How does an API add value to a PaaS offering? Considering the relationship between
      an API, and how it can benefit end-users of the platform is important to establishing
      a stable plan that can benefit both sides of the operation in harmony.

    about: Is a primary focus of an API platform centered around driving traffic to
      a web or mobile presence. If there is a solid business model around users accessing
      content or data, driving traffic through an API, without charging API consumers
      can be a successful approach.  How can API consumers be incentivized to drive
      more traffic to web and mobile properties, by extending the reach of the platform
      through APIs.

    category_about: These are the key elements of API plans that I have gathered from
      across hundreds of API providers. These elements can be associated with specific
      plans that are available, but they do not have to, and I often use them to generally
      describe the plans, or perceived plans behind API operations. These are the
      elements you should be considering as part of your own plans. You do not have
      to use all of them, but hopefully they will help you better understand the possibilities
      when it comes to API planning.

    about: There are APIs available to access all or part of the plans, pricing, or
      limitations around an API platform operations. The API platforms I track on
      that have been around the longest, and are the most mature, have APIs for consumers
      to use, that gives access to plan information, rate limits, pricing, and other
      aspects of API operations. I include this as essential, because it will be something
      every API provider will need to complete in the future.
