<p>It would be easy to have labeled this research API pricing, but there is so much more to making an API work at the business level, beyond just pricing. I wanted my research to look at how leading APIs of all sorts, structure their plans. Some of the times this is spelled out on a single pricing API, with access levels broken out by plan, while other times you have to make assumptions, and apply some experience to figuring out the plan behind an API.</p>
<p>Ive looked at 100+ APIs, and evaluated what the plans might be for the operations, and assembled into an aggregate set of building blocks than can be considered when crafting any API plans, or plans--borrowing from the best practices that already exisst in the space. I've broken these elements into elements, timeframes, metrics, geo, limits, resources, and extensions.</p>
<p>I've tried to provide some examples of companies with some interesting approaches, as well as a complete list of building blocks you can work with. However, I am now including a journey version of my research, which uses a subway map to help organize, and explore each area of my API plans research, as well as each potential stop along the API lifecycle.</p>

I try to be as fair as I can when covering companies, individuals, and the tools they provide, but ultimately you will notice I have my favorites, and there are some areas I only touch on lightly, for a variety of personal reasons.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
